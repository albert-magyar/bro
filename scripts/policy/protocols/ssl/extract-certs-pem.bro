##! This script is used to extract host certificates seen on the wire to disk
##! after being converted to PEM files.  The certificates will be stored in
##! a single file, one for local certificates and one for remote certificates.
##!
##! ..note::
##!
##!     - It doesn't work well on a cluster because each worker will write its
##!       own certificate files and no duplicate checking is done across
##!       clusters so each node would log each certificate.
