## Generated for SSL/TLS alert records. SSL/TLS sessions start with an
## unencrypted handshake, and Bro extracts as much information out of that as

## Generated for SSL/TLS handshake messages that are a part of the
## stateless-server session resumption mechanism. SSL/TLS sessions start with
## an unencrypted handshake, and Bro extracts as much information out of that
## as it can. This event is raised when an SSL/TLS server passes a session
## ticket to the client that can later be used for resuming the session. The
## mechanism is described in :rfc:`4507`

## Generated for X509 certificates seen in SSL/TLS connections. During the
